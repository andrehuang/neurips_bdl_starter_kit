# NeurIPS BDL Approximate Inference Competition - Starting Kit

This is a starting kit for the BDL competition.

Included are two IPython notebooks (one for PyTorch, one for JAX) that show
how to create an initial submission.

## Colabs
Here are colab links to the notebooks:

* [Getting started [JAX]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/izmailovpavel/neurips_bdl_starter_kit/blob/main/getting_started_jax.ipynb)
* [Getting started [PyTorch]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/izmailovpavel/neurips_bdl_starter_kit/blob/main/getting_started_pytorch.ipynb)
